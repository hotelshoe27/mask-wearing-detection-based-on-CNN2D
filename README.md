# mask-wearing-detection-based-on-CNN2D  

**This CNN based model detects whether a mask is worn using OpenCV, cvlib.**

See requirements.txt before testing and check detail through source codeðŸ‘€

and Plz follwoing this belowðŸ’¨

### 1_Create a dataset

- Create a dataset using 'Get_img_data.py' like this below.(I'm not so handsome, so I blurred itðŸ˜…)  
- Automatically capture the face area at regular intervals. At this time, it's better to capture the left and right sides together.  

**Example: Wearing a mask data**

### 2_Model training

- Train a model based on CNN2D through 'Model_build.py' file. In this project case, it used three CNN2D and See source code for details about model.  
- Also, The sample test results were got from built model through each 150 mask and nomask images.
